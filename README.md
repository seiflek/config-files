# Simple configuration files

**Some simple configuration files for some tools and utilities.**   

For the i3-gaps, copy the files inside the i3-gaps folder, 
paste them into your i3 config folder (usually *~/.i3/*).  
You'll need to have i3-gaps installed along with i3blocks, 
font-awesome for the bar icons, dmenu, feh for setting up the 
wallpaper and compton to enable some fading effects, reduce 
screen tearing and enable terminal-emulators transparency effect.
